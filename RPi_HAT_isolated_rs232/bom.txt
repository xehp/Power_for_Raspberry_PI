J3
	02x20 connector for RPi GPIO.
	https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/gpio/
	https://github.com/raspberrypi/hats/blob/master/designguide.md#back-powering-the-pi-via-the-j8-gpio-header


	Each of these 17 GPIO pins can deliver a maximum of 15mA current. And the sum of currents from all GPIO cannot exceed 50mA.


	Dimensions: 5mm x 51mm x 16.5mm / 0.2" x 2" x 0.65", Pins: 3mm
	Distance between boards is 13.5 mm.

	GPIO HEADER FOR RASPBERRYPI A+/B
		digikey:1528-1969-ND

	Hex Standoff Threaded M3 Nylon 0.530" (13.46mm) Natural
		digikey:RPC1485-ND

	The above "Distance between boards" did not match. It was more like 16 mm. 
	To be an official HAT the requirement is:
		It uses a GPIO connector that spaces the HAT between 10mm and 
		12mm from the Pi (i.e. uses spacers between 10mm and 12mm).
	We will use the 16 mm one for now. We make our own box/enclosure anyway.

	In next version we shall use this one:
		digikey:1528-2831-ND
	That will make the HAT sit 5 mm lower and that is what RaspberryPI HAT requirements say it shall be.


	Suggested GPIO for push buttons:
	17, 22, 23, 27





U2
	The HAT spec requires this EEPROM with system information
	to be in place in order to be called a HAT. It should be set up as write
	protected (WP pin held high), so it may be desirable to either put a 
	jumper as shown to enable writing, or to hook up a spare IO pin to do so.

	We can skip this for now. We do not sell this item as an official Raspberry PI HAT anyway.

	HAT requirements:
		https://hackaday.io/project/20482-designing-a-raspberry-pi-hat
		https://github.com/raspberrypi/hats
			It has a valid ID EEPROM (including vendor info, GPIO map and valid device tree information).
		TODO So we need the format for this info.

	This one was out of stock.
	digikey:CAT24C32WI-GT3CT-ND

	Perhaps this will work as well? Have not tested.
	digikey:AT24C32E-SSHM-TCT-ND


	Then this info shall be stored in the EEPROM, see:

	The Raspberry HAT specification say:
		If back powering via the GPIO connector the HAT must be able to supply a minimum
		of 1.3A continuously to the Pi (but ability to supply 2A continuously recommended).
	This give 4 amps so plenty of margin.


	It shall have capacitors about 100 uF on input and output side but
	will load it only 50% so less capacitors should do.



	TODO:
		Did not really need an isolated module, could use a cheeper like this one:
			digikey:P78E05-1000

	Also the RPi GPIO shall not be loaded more than 15 mA (at least not continously).
	With 100 Ohm the current should be (3.3-2)/100 -> 13 mA that should be OK.
	Perhaps 68 or 82 Ohm is better?

Super capacitors

	The plan is to make a separate box with some capacitors and a diode.
        The diode is there in case capacitor box is incorrectly connected.

	10 in series, minimum 10F:
		
		CAPACITOR 10F -10% +30% 2.7V TH
		digikey:1572-1759-ND

		CAP 100F -10% +20% 2.7V T/H
		digikey:2085-TPL-100/22X45F-ND


	Energy in a capacitor is E=(1/2)*C*U*U

	So if RPi uses P (Watts) and we can use at least half of the energy stored
	we can run the RPi for this time:
		T=(1/2)*(E/P) = (1/4)*C*U*U/P

		With P = 10 W
		C = 1 F (10 capacitors of 10F in series)
		U = 23 V (24 - some drop over diodes)

		T = (1/4)*(1)*23*23/10 = 13 s

	That should be enough to save and halt.



Perhaps move the display 0.25 mm more to left (towards center of HAT board).
Note that U21 & J40 must also move same.


TODO Power
If RPi has halted due to power loss but power is back before UPS is discharged the RPi will not boot.
One way would be to make something using the CRTL on U21 to turn 5 Volt off and on again when 
power returns to main power input. To turn U21 off pull CTRL pin low.
A brownout detector would be good also.
We should probably have had a reset button also.
And a watchdog timer while at it.


TODO Serial ports
According to this we can perhaps use some of the additional UARTS that Raspberrt PI 4 have.
https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=244528
So:
dtoverlay -h uart2
This say that uart2 (AKA /dev/ttyAMA1) is on GPIO 0-3. 
A bit inconvenient since GPIO 0 & 1 is used for ID EEPROM on the HAT.

dtoverlay -h uart3
Much better, GPIO 4 & 5 are currently not used.
So uart3 AKA /dev/ttyAMA2 we could use.
So I guess these are the pins:
GPIO4: TXD3
GPIO5: RXD3
